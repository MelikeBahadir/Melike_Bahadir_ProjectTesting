> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?

     	It was very interesting to test GitLab. I didn't know the web application before. Therefore, I could really test the web application from a beginner's perspective. 
	Overall, I was able to quickly familiarize myself with the web application as it is relatively intuitive.

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.

    	First, I familiarized myself with the process of creating test cases in general. The materials available in Canvas and the last Zoom session helped me a lot with this. Parallel to
	the templates, I opened GitLab and tried my way through each page. I followed the tasks in GitLab step by step and wrote the test cases at the same time. At the end, I checked
	whether the test cases made sense, whether enough variables had been declared, whether errors had crept in or whether something needed to be added.

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
   
	As I don't come from a computer science or IT background, but study industrial engineering, I haven't worked with test case management tools before. However, I have found GitLab to be a very
	good tool with potential. Should I need a test case management tool in the future, I would probably use GitLab as I am now somewhat familiar with it.

## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?

	I used the Editor app to open the text files and edit them. As I had no problems with this, I did not check any other IDE.
     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?

	On the whole, I had no problems with the task. As soon as you got to know the task, it became easier. 

## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?

 	I had never used GitLab before. Nevertheless, I had no major difficulties the first time I used it. Of course, you have to familiarize yourself with the web application first. But
	it became easier and easier to use.        

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )

	I have already programmed with Python during my studies and was able to gain good experience. Therefore, if I need to automate test cases in the future, I would probably use Python
	as my preferred programming language for test automation. Since I already have experience with Python, continuing to use this language for test automation would increase my
	productivity. Also, Python has extensive library support and is overall versatile.

## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
	
	-Test automation
	-Knowledge of programming languages (such as Java, Python, or C++)
	-Experience with testing frameworks (such as Selenium or Appium)
	-Knowledge of scripting languages (such as Bash or PowerShell)
	-Familiarity with continuous integration and deployment tools (such as Jenkins or Git)
	-Understanding of Agile methodologies
	-Strong problem-solving and analytical skills
	-Excellent communication and collaboration abilities
	-Attention to detail and strong organizational skills
	-Experience with testing tools and technologies (such as JUnit or TestNG)
	-Knowledge of database systems and SQL queries
	-Experience with defect tracking systems (such as Jira)
	-Ability to create test plans, test cases, and test scenarios
	-Understanding of software development lifecycle and quality assurance processes
	-Knowledge of software testing techniques and best practices
	-Familiarity with different types of testing (such as unit testing, integration testing, or performance testing)

## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?

	If one day I decide to take a new path in my career and become a software tester, it would probably make sense to take a new degree course that would deepen the knowledge required.
	The knowledge from my engineering degree will probably not be enough. And even though you can gain a lot of knowledge through courses and certificates, I think it makes the most
	sense to do a full degree in addition to the certificates to improve your resume.

## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 

	I found this course very interesting. I learned a lot and was able to expand my portfolio with more basics in a new area. I particularly liked the fact that we were able to carry
	out a practical project at the end of the course and didn't just learn theoretical content. The theoretical content was conveyed well through the literature and videos. I think
	that the whole course provides a good basis for testing software. I particularly like the possibility of obtaining ISTQB certification afterward, which also looks good on a CV.
